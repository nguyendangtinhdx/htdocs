  In 1964, guitarist David St. Hubbins (formerly of The Creatures) and Nigel Tufnel (formerly of The Lovely Lads) formed The Originals, but because there was already a band named that, they changed to The New Originals. Then, in late 1964, they changed the name to The Thamesmen. Then in late '65 or early '66, they went through rapidfire personnel and name changes, including: The Dutchmen, Rave Breakers, Hellcats, Flamin' Daemons, Shiners, Mondos, The Doppel Gang, The Peoples, Loose Lips, Waffles, Hot Waffles, Silver Service, Bisquits, Love Bisquits, The Mud Below, and the Tufnel-St. Hubbins Group before settling on Spinal Tap in December of 1966. In late 1967, bassist Derek Smalls (formerly of Teddy Noise, Skaface and Milage) permanently joined the lineup.

In 1976 the band played under the names Anthem and The Cadburys while having legal difficulties with their record label, Megaphone. And of course they played at least one gig as Spinal Tap Mark II when Nigel briefly walked out on their 1982 US Tour. Sheesh! These guys make this job hard. For other Spinal Tap related bands, such as bands they toured with, the bands members came from, the bands members joined or started after leaving, and band member side projects, check out Chip Rowe's comprehensive Spinal Tap site. Or visit the band's official web page and see if the joke has worn thin and Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean should just get on with their careers. Crap, I hope not!
